## This is the code for explore the research question 'How can new algebraic graph invariants be developed and utilized to distinguish between different sentiment trends in social media datasets, and what insights can this differentiation provide into the dynamics of public opinion on key issues, especially in Twitter?'

### First of all, the dataset used in this work is from Kaggle, and here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaileekapadia/twitter-autism.

#### In order to the code, store and unzip the datasets under a folder called 'dataset'.
#### First of all, run the file datasets_sentiments.ipynb, to get the cleaned and pre-processed datasets with sentiment scores.
#### Secondly, run the file EDA.ipynb to get the EDA plots.
#### Thirdly, run the file called network_plots.ipynb to get the majority plots for the networks for the both datasets.
#### The fourth step is optional, you are able to run the code in tables.ipynb to get all the tables about the metrics values in network plots.
