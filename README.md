## This is the code for explore the research question 'How do degree-based graphic invariants,such as Wiener Index and Hyper-Wiener Index, characterize and reveal patterns in the discourse about autism on Twitter?'

### First of all, the dataset used in this work is from Kaggle, and here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaileekapadia/twitter-autism

#### In order to the code, store the datasets under a folder called 'dataset'
#### Run the file all_autism.ipynb first to get the cleaned and pre-processed datasets with sentiment scores.
#### Then run the file called topic_model+datasets_network.ipynb to get the final datasets for user-interaction networks and the images for hashtags distributions.
#### Finally, run the file called network_analyze.ipynb to get the majority plots.
