## This is the code for explore the research question 'How can new algebraic graph invariants be developed and utilized to distinguish between different sentiment trends in social media datasets, and what insights can this differentiation provide into the dynamics of public opinion on key issues, especially in Twitter?'

### First of all, the dataset used in this work is from Kaggle, and here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaileekapadia/twitter-autism

#### In order to the code, store the datasets under a folder called 'dataset'
#### Run the file all_autism.ipynb first to get the cleaned datasets with sentiment scores.
#### Then run the file called topic_model+metrics.ipynb to get all the results and visualizations that are used in the paper.
